# Nonsense Quiz App

This is a simple React Native app for practicing nonsense quizzes. It provides
three main features:

1. **퀴즈 모음 검색** – search through existing quiz questions.
2. **퀴즈 맞추기** – play the quiz game, select answers in word order and
   provide feedback for each question. At the end, a scoreboard tracks your
   score by name.
3. **퀴즈 등록** – register new quiz questions. They are stored for admin
   approval.

All data is kept in memory for simplicity.
